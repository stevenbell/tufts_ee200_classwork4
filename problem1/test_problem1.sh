# This is a shell script which you can use to test your code
# To provide input, you can pipe text to standard input, which will be read by scanf

# `echo` just prints out whatever its command-line arguments are, and
# the `|` pipes the output of one command to the input of another.

echo "10 + 5" | ./problem1

# Add more test cases as necessary
